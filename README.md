#### A Focus On Customer Behavior And Product Performance

## Introduction
### Sales Performance Insights
Using sales data across months, days, stores, and brand-pack sizes, this analysis identifies revenue patterns and customer behaviors. 
The aim is to optimize marketing campaigns, promotions, and stock allocation to maximize revenue during high-demand periods and from top-performing segments

## Problem Statement
The business currently lacks targeted strategies to:
-	Capitalize on seasonal and weekly sales peaks.
-	Focus efforts on high-value customer segments.
-	Prioritize top brands and pack sizes that generate the most revenue.
-	Drive premium segment purchases through tailored offers.
This limits the ability to fully exploit demand patterns, improve inventory management, and boost profitability.

## Methodology
1. Data Extraction – SQL queries to retrieve transaction, store, and product details.
2.	Data Cleaning & Processing – Python (Pandas, NumPy) used for merging datasets, handling missing data, and parsing time/date fields.
3.	Exploratory Analysis – Power BI and Excel pivot tables used to generate:
-	Monthly and weekly sales trends
-	Store revenue performance
-	Brand-pack size revenue breakdown
-	Customer Segmentation and LifeStage Performance
4.	Statistical Modeling – Python regression analysis to quantify relationships between sales, pack size, and units sold.
5.	Visualization & Reporting – Insights summarized in PowerPoint with supporting charts from Power BI and Excel.
